# battleship
Developed a two-player Battleship game with real-time network communication using Python sockets. Designed game logic for handling attacks, ship placement, and win conditions with classes for players and the game board. Integrated JSON for data exchange between server and client, enabling synchronization of ship locations and attack results between players. Implemented features for tracking hits, misses, and ships across the board using object-oriented principles and error handling.
